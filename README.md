# Social Media Analytics App

A Python-based social media application demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP), a Tkinter GUI, and SQLite database integration. This project was designed to showcase core software development and debugging practices.

## Features

- **User Interface:** Built with Tkinter for creating and submitting posts with file attachments.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Utilizes Python classes to manage post data and application logic.
- **Database Integration:** Uses SQLite to persistently store posts, file details, and track basic analytics (likes, views).
- **Debugging Ready:** Code is structured to be easily analyzed with debuggers like in VS Code.

## Key Implementation Details

- **`submit_post()` Function:** Handles the core logic of processing user input, creating `Post` objects, and interacting with the database.
- **Database Schema:** Includes `Posts` and `Analytics` tables for storing content and engagement metrics.
- **Tkinter UI:** Features a dynamic interface for post creation with file dialog functionality.

## Demo & Walkthrough

A video demo is available, walking through the code execution using VS Code's debugger:
- Setting breakpoints in the `submit_post()` function.
- Stepping through code to observe object manipulation and data flow.
- Inspecting variables and explaining database interaction logic.
